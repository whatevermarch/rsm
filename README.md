# Reflective Shadow Map
(Very) Naive implementation of [Reflective Shadow Map](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1053427.1053460) without Screen-space interpolation or any optimization. This demo is based on [Cauldron Framework](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/Cauldron), and it only exploits Vulkan backend.

## Prerequisites
The following packages need to be installed in order to run this demo.
- CMake 3.16
- Visual Studio 2017
- Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 (for DirectXMath)
- Vulkan SDK 1.2.131.2

## Build Instruction
- Create blank directory on the root directory of this repository. Let's say `build/` for example.
- Change directory to `build/`, and run `cmake ..`.
- Now you will see a Visual Studio solution file. Open it and build.
- The execution file will be in `bin/` at the root directory. (Or you can also execute it via Visual Studio Local Debugger.)
